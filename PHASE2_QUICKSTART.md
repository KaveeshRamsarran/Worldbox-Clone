# Quick Start - Phase 2 Features

## 🎮 How to Use the New Features

### 1. Enhanced Creatures
Simply click any creature button and watch them spawn with detailed, improved appearance!

**What to Notice:**
- Each race has unique, recognizable look (elves have pointed ears, dwarves have beards, etc.)
- Animals have more realistic proportions and details
- Color schemes match their personalities

---

### 2. Terrain Collision in Action
Create a world with mountains and water, then spawn creatures.

**What to Watch For:**
- Creatures navigate around mountains instead of getting stuck
- Water and lava slow creatures down but don't kill them instantly
- Creatures won't fall off the edge of the map
- Each creature finds alternate paths when blocked

**Try This:**
1. Select world shape: "Island" (creates water around edges)
2. Start game and spawn humans
3. Watch them avoid the water boundary intelligently

---

### 3. Civilizations Building
Watch civilizations develop automatically!

**How It Happens:**
- Humanoid creatures (human, elf, dwarf, orc, undead) will build houses, roads, and town halls
- No player action needed - just watch!
- Buildings appear over time as your civilization grows

**What Each Building Does:**
- **Houses** (brown peaked roof): Population centers, show population number above
- **Roads** (gray path): Connect buildings together, visual pathways
- **Town Halls** (large stone building with flag): Government centers

**To Speed Up Building:**
- Create lots of humanoid creatures (click human/elf/dwarf buttons)
- More creatures = more building activity
- Buildings cluster near each other naturally

**Try This Scenario:**
1. Spawn 20 humans in one area
2. Watch them build houses and roads around each other
3. Change to another race and spawn them elsewhere
4. See different civilizations develop independently

---

### 4. Natural Creature Spawning

**What to Notice:**
- New creatures appear on their own
- Population stays balanced (doesn't grow infinitely)
- Different species spawn in appropriate terrain
- Fish spawn in water, birds can spawn anywhere

**Population Limits:**
- Maximum 150 creatures total
- Each species has limits (humans max 30, wolves max 15, etc.)
- System respects these automatically

**To See It Best:**
1. Start game with medium or large world
2. Don't spawn anything initially
3. Wait 30 seconds - creatures will appear!
4. Watch populations grow and stabilize

## 🌍 Recommended Gameplay Loop

1. **Choose World Settings** in launcher
   - Try large or huge world for more activity
   - Try circular or island shapes for natural boundaries

2. **Start Game** and observe natural spawning
   - Watch creatures populate the world
   - See buildings start to appear

3. **Occasionally Add Creatures** with UI buttons
   - Create conflicts (orcs vs humans)
   - Balance populations
   - Guide civilization development

4. **Use Hazards** to influence world
   - Meteor strikes destroy structures
   - Plague affects populations
   - Tsunamis reshape water boundaries

5. **Watch It Unfold**
   - Civilizations rise and fall
   - Ecosystems balance
   - Emergent gameplay develops

## 📊 What the Stats Panel Shows

- **Population**: Total creatures in world
- **Humans/Elves/Dwarves/etc**: Count of each type
- **Year**: Time passed (updates every 60 frames)

**Watch How These Change:**
- Humanoids building = population stable or growing
- Hazards strike = sudden population drops
- No food sources = populations eventually decline

## 🎯 Advanced Tips

### Creating Civilizations:
1. Spawn many of one race (20+ creatures)
2. Let them build naturally
3. You'll see houses and town halls form
4. Population numbers show above houses

### Ecosystem Balance:
- More creatures = more building
- Different species = different behaviors
- Predators (wolves/bears) hunt herbivores (deer)
- Humanoids ignore animals and build instead

### Observing Emergent Behavior:
- Creatures naturally cluster in habitable areas
- Buildings form near other buildings
- Roads sometimes connect structures
- Populations self-regulate through survival

### Causing Chaos:
- Spawn many opposing civilizations
- Use hazards to cause conflict
- Watch populations struggle and rebuild
- See which civilizations survive

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

**Creatures not building houses?**
- Make sure you have humanoid creatures (not animals)
- Building is random - may take 2-5 minutes to see first house
- Spawn 20+ humanoids to speed up building

**Spawned creatures disappear?**
- They die from starvation (no food system yet) after ~1000 frames
- Create new creatures to maintain population
- Watch stats panel to see decline

**Road tiles not appearing?**
- Roads blend with grass background
- Look for the gray paved path with gold lines
- They appear between houses

**Buildings covering creatures?**
- This is intentional - buildings render on top
- Creatures still move around buildings normally

## 🎉 Have Fun!

The beauty of Phase 2 is watching emergent gameplay unfold. Every world is different:
- Different civilizations rise to dominance
